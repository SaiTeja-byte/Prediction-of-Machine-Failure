Machine Failure Prediction using Random Forest

# About Dataset
## Dataset Overview
This dataset contains sensor data collected from various machines, with the aim of predicting machine failures in advance. It includes a variety of sensor readings as well as the recorded machine failures.

## Columns Description
1. footfall: The number of people or objects passing by the machine.
2. temp Mode: The temperature mode or setting of the machine.
3. AQ: Air quality index near the machine.
4. USS: Ultrasonic sensor data, indicating proximity measurements.
5. CS: Current sensor readings, indicating the electrical current usage of the machine.
6. VOC: Volatile organic compounds level detected near the machine.
7. RP: Rotational position or RPM (revolutions per minute) of the machine parts.
8. IP: Input pressure to the machine.
9. Temperature: The operating temperature of the machine.
10. fail: Binary indicator of machine failure (1 for failure, 0 for no failure).
